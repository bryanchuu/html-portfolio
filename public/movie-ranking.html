<h1>The Best Series According to Bryan</h1>

<h2>This is just my opinion of which TV series are the most enjoyable for me.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>
I like it when Walter White breaks the bad.
</p>

<h3>Better Call Saul</h3>
<p>
 My favorite part is when Saul Goodman says "It's Saulin' Time!", and then proceeds to talk to Mike.   
</p>

<h3>Peaky Blinders</h3>
<p>
When the blinders are peaky.
